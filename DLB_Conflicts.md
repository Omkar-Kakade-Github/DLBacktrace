## Project DLBacktrace: Relevance Propagation Handler Benchmarking & Refinement - A Development Chronicle

**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Project Goal:** Benchmark original (NumPy-based) vs. refactored (C++/CUDA optimized) relevance propagation (LRP) handlers for a VGG19 model, ensuring both performance improvements and numerical accuracy.

### 1. Introduction & Initial Objective

The primary goal was to compare the performance (execution speed) and numerical output of existing LRP handlers (`prop.py`) with newly refactored and CUDA-optimized handlers (`vgg_layers.py`) within the `DLBacktrace` framework. The VGG19 model, adapted for the CIFAR10 dataset, served as the testbed. Success required not only demonstrating a speedup with the refactored handlers but also ensuring their LRP results were numerically consistent with the original, trusted implementations.

### 2. Initial Setup & Core Modifications

The process began by setting up the necessary infrastructure and making foundational code changes:

1.  **`DLBacktrace/main/pytorch_backtrace/logic/backtrace.py`:**
    *   A boolean flag `use_refactored_handlers` was introduced to the `eval` and `proportional_eval` methods.
    *   `proportional_eval` was modified to dynamically select the LRP rule implementations:
        *   `UP_ORIGINAL` (from `.../utils/prop.py`) if `use_refactored_handlers=False`.
        *   `UP_REFACTORED` (from `.../utils/layer_refactors/vgg_layers.py`) if `use_refactored_handlers=True`.
    *   Initial logic for data transpositions (e.g., CHW to HWC) was added for Conv2D and MaxPool2D layers when using refactored handlers.

2.  **`DLBacktrace/main/pytorch_backtrace/models/simple_vgg.py`:**
    *   Initially, a `SimpleVGG` model was used.
    *   This was replaced with a more standard `VGG19` model definition.
    *   A `load_pretrained_vgg` function was added to load weights from `torchvision` and adapt the final classifier for the CIFAR10 dataset (10 classes). This included handling potential mismatches in layer names/structures if the pre-trained model's final layer differed.

3.  **`DLBacktrace/tests/benchmark_vgg_backtrace.py`:**
    *   A new benchmarking script was created to automate the comparison.
    *   **Key functionalities:**
        *   Load CIFAR10 dataset (resized to 224x224).
        *   Initialize `VGG19` model, move to GPU if available.
        *   Initialize `BacktracePyTorch` object.
        *   Fetch a data batch.
        *   Obtain all layer activations using `backtrace_obj.predict()`.
        *   Run `backtrace_obj.eval()` twice: once with `use_refactored_handlers=False` and once with `use_refactored_handlers=True`.
        *   Time both runs and calculate speedup.
        *   Later, a `compare_relevance_results` function was added to check numerical consistency.

4.  **`DLBacktrace/main/pytorch_backtrace/logic/config.py`:**
    *   The `activation_master` dictionary was updated to include default `"params": {"mul_val": 1.0, "const_val": 0.0, "add_val": 0.0}` for various activation types (None, linear, relu, etc.). This was crucial for ensuring that LRP rules in `prop.py` expecting these parameters didn't fail with `KeyError`.

### 3. Iterative Debugging & Refinement - Original Handlers (`prop.py`)

Running the benchmark script with the original handlers (`use_refactored_handlers=False`) on the VGG19 model (especially with GPU tensors) revealed several issues that needed addressing in `prop.py`:

1.  **`TypeError`: Cannot convert CUDA tensor to NumPy.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_fc`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Calling `.numpy()` directly on a PyTorch tensor residing on the GPU (e.g., model weights `w`, `b`).
    *   **Fix:** Modified to use `w.cpu().detach().numpy()` and `b.cpu().detach().numpy()`. `detach()` was added later when gradient issues arose.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

2.  **`KeyError: 'params'`.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_fc` when accessing `activation_conf["params"]`.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `activation_conf` (often derived from `activation_master["None"]`) did not have the "params" sub-dictionary, which the LRP rules in `prop.py` expected.
    *   **Fix:** Added default "params" to relevant entries in `activation_master` in `config.py`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `config.py`, `prop.py` (to correctly use these params).

3.  **`ValueError`: `np.einsum` dimension mismatch.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_fc`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Input relevance `wts` or activations `inp` sometimes had an unexpected batch dimension of 1 (e.g., shape `(1, J)` instead of `(J,)`), causing `einsum` to fail with certain subscript patterns.
    *   **Fix:** Added logic to squeeze the batch dimension from `inp` and `wts` if their shape indicated a batch size of 1. `einsum` calls were refined.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

4.  **`ValueError`: `np.pad` broadcast error for `pad_width`.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_padding` (called by `calculate_wt_maxpool`).
    *   **Root Cause:** `np.pad` received a `pad_width` suitable for a 3D array, but the input array `inp` (after transpositions in `calculate_wt_maxpool`) was effectively 4D due to the batch dimension not being consistently handled for padding calculations.
    *   **Fix:**
        *   Refactored `calculate_padding` to explicitly expect a 3D shape `(W,H,C)` for its input shape argument and calculate padding for these 3 dimensions.
        *   Refactored `calculate_wt_maxpool` to squeeze batch dimensions, transpose to an internal `(W,H,C)` convention, call the updated `calculate_padding`, apply padding, process, unpad, and then re-transpose and re-add batch dimension.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

5.  **`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'cpu'`.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_conv`.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `inp` or `wts` variables were already NumPy arrays (from a previous step or initial CPU data) but were being passed through `.cpu().detach().numpy()` again.
    *   **Fix:** Added checks `isinstance(inp, torch.Tensor)` before attempting PyTorch-specific operations.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

6.  **`TypeError: can't convert CUDA tensor to numpy. Use Tensor.cpu() to copy the tensor to host memory first`.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_conv_unit` (called by `calculate_wt_conv`).
    *   **Root Cause:** Weight (`w`) and bias (`b`) tensors (passed from `calculate_wt_conv`) were still on GPU when `.numpy()` was called inside `calculate_wt_conv_unit`.
    *   **Fix:** Added `.cpu()` before `.numpy()` for `w` and `b` within `calculate_wt_conv_unit`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

7.  **`RuntimeError: Can't call numpy() on Tensor that requires grad. Use tensor.detach().numpy() instead`.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_conv_unit`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Tensors `w` and `b` still required gradients.
    *   **Fix:** Added `.detach()` before `.cpu().numpy()` for `w` and `b` inside `calculate_wt_conv_unit`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

8.  **`ValueError: einstein sum subscript string contains too many subscripts for operand 0` (and similar `einsum` issues).**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_wt_conv_unit`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Mismatched `einsum` patterns or incorrect assumptions about operand shapes (particularly `k` kernel and `patch`) after previous fixes and transpositions. The LRP rule for distributing relevance based on positive/negative contributions was also being refined here.
    *   **Fix:** This required several iterations. The `einsum` strings were corrected (e.g., `"oihw,hwi->oihw"` for `conv_out`). The logic for summing positive (`p_sum`) and negative (`n_sum`) contributions and then distributing `wts` (output relevance) was substantially refactored to ensure correct broadcasting and summation according to LRP principles. This involved ensuring `p_ind_contrib`, `n_ind_contrib` were correctly formed and used. (This fix had issues with automated application and required retries/manual guidance for the AI).
    *   **Files Modified:** `prop.py`.

### 4. Iterative Debugging & Refinement - Refactored Handlers (`vgg_layers.py` & `backtrace.py` integration)

Once the original handlers were working, attention shifted to the refactored CUDA handlers (`use_refactored_handlers=True`):

1.  **Shape Validation Error in `calculate_fc_input_relevance_pytorch_cuda` (`vgg_layers.py`).**
    *   **Root Cause:** The function expected 1D tensors for output relevance and input activations after a flatten layer, but they were being passed with a batch dimension of 1 (e.g., `(1, N)`).
    *   **Fix:** Added logic to `.squeeze(0)` the `output_relevance_t` and `input_activations_t` if they were 2D with a leading dimension of 1, before shape validation.
    *   **Files Modified:** `vgg_layers.py`.

2.  **`TypeError`: Attempted to concatenate a NumPy array in `torch.cat`.**
    *   **Context:** In `proportional_eval` in `backtrace.py` when accumulating `all_wt`.
    *   **Root Cause:** `temp_wt` returned by refactored Linear/Conv handlers was a PyTorch tensor, while `all_wt` was a dictionary of NumPy arrays. The `+=` operation failed.
    *   **Fix:** Explicitly converted `temp_wt` to a CPU NumPy array (`temp_wt.cpu().detach().numpy()`) after calls to refactored Linear/Conv handlers before adding to `all_wt`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `backtrace.py`.

3.  **`torch.OutOfMemoryError`: CUDA out of memory.**
    *   **Context:** In `calculate_fc_input_relevance_pytorch_cuda` (`vgg_layers.py`).
    *   **Root Cause:** Large intermediate tensors created during relevance calculation, especially matrix multiplications involving `fc_weights_t_pos` and `fc_weights_t_neg`.
    *   **Fix:** Reordered multiplication and division operations to reduce peak memory usage (e.g., `(A/B)*C` instead of `(A*C)/B` if `A*C` is huge). Added `del` statements for intermediate tensors like `factor_pos_b`, `factor_neg_b` after use.
    *   **Files Modified:** `vgg_layers.py`.

4.  **`AttributeError: module '...vgg_layers' has no attribute 'calculate_wt_rshp'`.**
    *   **Context:** In `proportional_eval` (`backtrace.py`) for "Flatten" layers.
    *   **Root Cause:** The refactored reshape function in `vgg_layers.py` was named `reshape_tensor_pytorch_cuda`, not `calculate_wt_rshp` (which was the original name in `prop.py`).
    *   **Fix:** Updated `proportional_eval` to call `ActiveUP.reshape_tensor_pytorch_cuda` when `use_refactored_handlers` is true for "Flatten" layers. Ensured inputs were converted to tensors.
    *   **Files Modified:** `backtrace.py`.

5.  **`TypeError: calculate_wt_maxpool_pytorch_cuda() received an invalid combination of arguments`.**
    *   **Context:** In `proportional_eval` (`backtrace.py`) for "MaxPool2d" layers.
    *   **Root Cause:** NumPy arrays (`_input_act_hwc`, `_relevance_ohw_outc`) were being passed directly to the CUDA function which expected PyTorch tensors.
    *   **Fix:** Converted NumPy inputs to PyTorch CUDA tensors before calling `calculate_wt_maxpool_pytorch_cuda`. Converted the returned tensor back to NumPy.
    *   **Files Modified:** `backtrace.py`.

6.  **`TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable int object`.**
    *   **Context:** Inside `calculate_wt_maxpool_pytorch_cuda` (`vgg_layers.py`) when unpacking `strides_hw`.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `stride_val` from `module_obj.stride` for MaxPool2d could be an `int`, but the CUDA function expected a tuple `(sH, sW)`.
    *   **Fix:** In `proportional_eval` (`backtrace.py`), ensured `stride_val` was converted to a tuple `(stride_val, stride_val)` if it was an `int` before passing to the refactored MaxPool2d handler.
    *   **Files Modified:** `backtrace.py`.

7.  **`TypeError: calculate_padding_pytorch_cuda() got an unexpected keyword argument 'data_tensor'`.**
    *   **Context:** Inside `calculate_wt_maxpool_pytorch_cuda` and `calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda` (`vgg_layers.py`).
    *   **Root Cause:** The `calculate_padding_pytorch_cuda` function expected `input_tensor` as its first argument name, but was called with `data_tensor`.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected the keyword argument name to `input_tensor` in the calls.
    *   **Files Modified:** `vgg_layers.py`.

8.  **`TypeError: pad(): argument 'input' (position 1) must be Tensor, not numpy.ndarray`.**
    *   **Context:** In `proportional_eval` (`backtrace.py`) for "Conv2d" layers with refactored handlers, during the call to `ActiveUP.calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda`. The error originated from `torch.nn.functional.pad` inside `calculate_padding_pytorch_cuda`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Although `calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda` was being called, the inputs (like `input_tensor_ihwc`) were being prepared as NumPy arrays initially and then converted to tensors *inside* the `proportional_eval` logic, but perhaps one was missed or converted too late/early relative to the padding call path. More specifically, the issue was traced to the main `input_activation_np` and `current_relevance_np` needing to be correctly transposed and then converted to tensors *before* being passed to the top-level refactored conv handler.
    *   **Fix:** Ensured that for "Conv2d" with refactored handlers:
        *   Necessary NumPy arrays (`np_input_act_hwc`, `np_relevance_ohw_outc`, `np_kernel_khw_inc_outc`, `np_bias_outc`) were prepared first (including transpositions and `.cpu().detach().numpy()` for weights/bias).
        *   These NumPy arrays were then converted to PyTorch CUDA tensors (`torch_input_ihwc`, etc.) *before* calling `ActiveUP.calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda`.
        *   The result from the CUDA function (a tensor) was converted back to a NumPy array for consistent accumulation.
    *   **Files Modified:** `backtrace.py`.

9.  **`torch.OutOfMemoryError`: CUDA out of memory.**
    *   **Context:** Inside `calculate_conv_unit_contribution_pytorch_cuda_batched` (called by `calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda` in `vgg_layers.py`).
    *   **Root Cause:** Processing a large number of patches (derived from input feature map and kernel configurations) simultaneously, especially the `einsum` for `conv_out` and subsequent operations, consumed too much GPU memory.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented chunking for processing patches. The `all_patches_np_khw_inc` (all extracted input patches) are processed in batches (`chunk_size`). The `calculate_conv_unit_contribution_pytorch_cuda_batched` function is called for each chunk, and results are accumulated. Intermediate tensors within the chunk processing were also managed with `del`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `vgg_layers.py` (mainly `calculate_wt_conv_pytorch_cuda` to implement the chunking loop around calls to the `_batched` unit function).

### 5. Numerical Accuracy Investigation & Potential Alignment

After resolving the runtime errors, benchmarks showed significant speedups (e.g., 3.75x-4.00x). However, numerical comparison revealed discrepancies:

*   **Initial Observation:** `dropout2` and `fc2/relu_fc2` (layers closest to output) matched perfectly. Mismatches, indicated by non-zero Mean Absolute Error (MAE), appeared from `dropout1` / `fc1/relu_fc1` backwards.
*   **Enhanced Comparison:** The `compare_relevance_results` function in `benchmark_vgg_backtrace.py` was enhanced to print detailed statistics (Min, Max, Mean, Std Dev for original, refactored, and their absolute difference).
*   **Key Finding from Detailed Stats:**
    *   For many deeper `Conv` layers, the original (`prop.py`) results showed negative minimum relevance values (e.g., `conv5_3/relu5_3` Min_Orig: `-6.9e-02`), while the refactored (`vgg_layers.py`) results consistently had non-negative minimums (often `0.0`).
    *   This suggested a fundamental difference in how LRP rules were implemented or stabilized, especially concerning positive and negative contributions.
*   **LRP Rule Investigation:**
    *   **`prop.py` (`calculate_wt_conv_unit` for "relu" activation):** Implements a Z+ rule: `R_i = sum_j ( (Z_ij^+ / (Z_j^+ + b_j^+ + eps) ) * R_j )`. This rule, if `R_j` (output relevance) is non-negative, should produce non-negative `R_i`.
    *   **`vgg_layers.py` (`calculate_conv_unit_contribution_pytorch_cuda_batched`):** Uses a denominator `sum_positive + sum_negative_abs + bias_positive_part + bias_negative_part` and distributes relevance via `positive_contributions` and `torch.abs(negative_contributions_orig_sign)`. This also inherently produces non-negative relevance if incoming relevance is non-negative.
*   **Source of Negative Values in Original:** The appearance of negative relevance in `original_results` (e.g., at `conv5_3/relu5_3`) when the Z+ rule was expected was puzzling. The hypothesis became that if `wts` (the output relevance `R_j` being propagated *from* the layer above) contained small negative values due to floating-point accumulations or slight variations in other rules (like FC), the Z+ rule in `prop.py` could propagate these negative values if `R_j` itself was negative, as it directly multiplies by `wts`. The `vgg_layers.py` version, using `torch.abs` for the negative contribution part of the *inputs*, might be more robust against this or implicitly enforce non-negativity more strictly.
*   **Proposed Final Alignment (Manual Change Suggested):** To make the `prop.py` behavior for ReLU-associated layers more strictly adhere to producing non-negative relevance (matching the apparent behavior of the refactored `vgg_layers.py`), the suggestion was to clamp the calculated relevance to be non-negative:
    *   In `prop.py` -> `calculate_wt_conv_unit` (relu case): change `relevance_map = rel_from_pos` to `relevance_map = np.maximum(0, rel_from_pos)`.
    *   In `prop.py` -> `calculate_wt_fc` (relu case): after `result_ = np.nansum(result_mat, axis=0)`, add `result_ = np.maximum(0, result_)`.
    *(Note: Automated application of this specific edit faced difficulties.)*

### 6. Pain Point Analysis & Recommendations for a Potential Rewrite

This iterative debugging process highlighted several areas that could be improved in a future redesign:

1.  **Data Type and Device Management (Tensor vs. NumPy, CPU vs. CUDA):**
    *   **Pain:** Frequent, error-prone conversions (`.cpu()`, `.detach()`, `.numpy()`, `torch.as_tensor()`). Source of numerous `TypeError` and `AttributeError`.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Establish a single data representation (ideally PyTorch tensors) for as much of the pipeline as possible.
        *   Define clear, robust interface points for any necessary conversions, with built-in checks.
        *   Consider a unified "RelevanceTensor" or "ActivationTensor" object that internally manages device and type, and provides safe conversion methods.

2.  **Array Shape, Dimension, and Layout Conventions:**
    *   **Pain:** Managing batch dimensions (squeezing/unsqueezing), transpositions between CHW (PyTorch default) and HWC/WHC (often used in custom NumPy/CUDA kernels), and ensuring correct `einsum` string and operand shapes.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Implement strict shape/dimension assertions at the entry/exit of all LRP handler functions.
        *   Standardize on a consistent internal data layout (e.g., always HWC for spatial processing) for all custom kernels, with explicit transpositions at the boundaries.
        *   Utilize libraries like `einops` or more descriptive variable names/comments to clarify tensor manipulations.

3.  **LRP Rule Consistency, Parameterization, and Explicitness:**
    *   **Pain:** Subtle differences in LRP rule implementations (stabilization, epsilon, handling of positive/negative parts, alpha/beta parameters) between `prop.py` and `vgg_layers.py` were the primary cause of numerical discrepancies. Implicit rule selection based on activation names or missing config keys was fragile.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Define LRP rules (e.g., LRP-0, LRP-epsilon, LRP-alpha-beta, LRP-gamma, Z+, Zbeta) as distinct, well-parameterized classes or functions.
        *   The choice of LRP rule for a layer should be an explicit parameter, not inferred.
        *   Centralize and clearly document stabilization strategies (e.g., epsilon value, method of addition).
        *   Make parameters like `alpha` and `beta` explicit inputs to rules that use them, avoiding reliance on `activation_conf` dictionaries that might not contain them.

4.  **Modularity, Abstraction, and Code Duplication:**
    *   **Pain:** The main `proportional_eval` loop in `backtrace.py` grew complex with `if use_refactored_handlers:` branching for many layer types, leading to duplicated logic for data preparation and result aggregation. While `_unit` functions helped, the overall flow was convoluted.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Design a cleaner, more abstract plugin-style architecture for layer handlers.
        *   Each combination of (LayerType, LRP_Rule_Variant, Backend_Engine [NumPy/PyTorchCPU/PyTorchCUDA]) could map to a specific handler object or function.
        *   This handler would have a standardized interface for:
            1.  Receiving input activations and output relevance.
            2.  Fetching layer parameters (weights, bias, stride, etc.).
            3.  Performing necessary data preparation (type/device conversion, transposition).
            4.  Executing the core LRP calculation.
            5.  Returning input relevance in a consistent format.

5.  **Debugging GPU Code & Memory Management:**
    *   **Pain:** GPU OOM errors required careful, sometimes iterative, memory optimization (e.g., `del` statements, input chunking for Conv layers). Debugging numerical issues on CUDA, even via PyTorch, can be less direct than CPU/NumPy.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Implement comprehensive unit tests for CUDA kernels using small, easy-to-verify inputs and expected outputs.
        *   Proactively profile GPU memory usage for complex operations.
        *   Make memory-saving techniques (like chunking) a configurable part of handlers for large layers.

6.  **Configuration Management (`config.py`):**
    *   **Pain:** The `activation_master` dictionary in `config.py`, while helpful, became a bit of an ad-hoc solution for providing default LRP parameters, leading to situations where missing keys (`alpha`, `beta`) caused fallback to different effective LRP rules.
    *   **Recommendation:** A more structured and explicit configuration system for LRP rules and their layer-specific parameters. This could involve separate configuration sections for different LRP rules, detailing all their necessary parameters.

7.  **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Pain:** While the end-to-end benchmark script was invaluable, the lack of granular unit tests for individual LRP handlers (especially for `prop.py`) made initial debugging slower, as errors were often caught late.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   Develop a robust test suite early in any rewrite.
        *   **Unit Tests:** For each LRP rule implementation (e.g., Z+ for Conv, LRP-epsilon for FC) and each backend (NumPy, CUDA), test with minimal inputs and analytically derived or manually verified expected outputs.
        *   **Integration Tests:** Test sequences of a few layers.
        *   **Numerical Comparison Tests:** Maintain a set of "golden" results from a trusted LRP implementation (even if slow, like a simplified Python version) or a published LRP toolkit, and regularly compare against these for key network architectures and layers.

### 7. Conclusion

The process of benchmarking, debugging, and refining the LRP handlers for VGG19 was challenging but highly informative. Significant performance gains were achieved with the refactored CUDA handlers. The investigation into numerical discrepancies pinpointed subtle but crucial differences in LRP rule implementations and stabilization techniques. The primary remaining challenge for full numerical equivalence (if desired beyond the current speedup) lies in perfectly aligning these LRP rule applications, particularly how positive and negative contributions are handled and how non-negativity is (or isn't strictly) enforced throughout the backward pass. The pain points identified provide a clear roadmap for designing a more robust, maintainable, and extensible LRP framework in the future.
